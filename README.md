# HTN 2020++
A discord bot to process the data and return a graph (or some other type of data processing the user may want).

The prefix is d!

For now, the only supported file type is .csv files. 

Here is the list of commands you can execute: 

graph <type of graph>

help

After typing in the graph command, you must upload a .csv file for the bot to be able to process your request. Otherwise, you must run the command one more time.

Types of graphs include:

Double bar graph: yy-bar

Double line graph: yy-line

Double scatter chart: yy-scatter
